The core problem statement is to design three unique user interface and user experience solutions for ClearCaptions phone captioning service, with a focus on user-friendliness, simplicity during onboarding, enhanced responsiveness, and reducing cognitive load for users aged 65 and above. The designs should not only empower users during stressful calls, but also aim to improve user satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS). They must be built in accordance with detailed business requirements and specifications, including functional and non-functional requirements, business rules, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Each design must stand out in its philosophy, key UX principles, visual style direction, user interface strategy, interaction patterns, and accessibility considerations. The ultimate objective of these designs is to create business value, satisfy stakeholder needs, and achieve measurable outcomes.
