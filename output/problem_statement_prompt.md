The problem we are addressing is the need to improve the user experience for older adults using our phone captioning services, particularly those over 65 who are interacting with our mobile app. The primary issues include a confusing interface and slow caption speed, which have led to a decrease in our Net Promoter Score (NPS). Users are struggling with onboarding and often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the app, leading to a sense of being "left behind" or "dumb". The goal is to reduce the cognitive load, speed up perceived responsiveness, and make the onboarding process friendlier. We need to reframe the entire experience to be empowering, not overwhelming, and ensure our users feel in control, especially during stressful calls. The design should also consider the backend capabilities related to caption speed, while ensuring the interface does not make the speed seem slower due to a cluttered or text-heavy screen.
