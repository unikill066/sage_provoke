# Creative Brief

## Problem Statement

The core problem to address is the need to improve the user experience for older adults using our phone captioning services, particularly those over 65 years old. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load, speed up perceived responsiveness, and make onboarding more intuitive. We aim to make the user experience empowering and not overwhelming, taking into account emotional drivers of our users who desire simplicity, confidence, and control, especially during stressful calls.

## Selected Concept

### Concept 2: Adaptive Caption Speed

#### Benefits

Allowing users to adjust the speed of captions can improve the user experience, especially during stressful calls. Slower speeds can help users who read slowly, while faster speeds can keep up with rapid conversations.

#### Drawbacks

Implementing this feature might increase the complexity of the interface and confuse some users.

#### Technical Feasibility

Medium. It requires changes in both the front-end (user controls) and back-end (captioning system).

#### Dependencies

Development team, user feedback, and testing.

#### Success Metrics

Reduced user complaints about caption speed, increased user satisfaction scores, increased usage.

## Persona Profile
