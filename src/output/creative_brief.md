# Creative Brief: Simplified Onboarding Process for Phone Captioning Services

## Problem Statement
Our phone captioning services' existing user interface is not effectively catering to our user base primarily comprised of individuals over 65, resulting in a lower NPS. Users find the interface perplexing, the caption speed tardy, and the onboarding process too complex. The objective is to transform the entire experience into something empowering rather than overwhelming.

## Concept Overview
Simplified Onboarding Process - A simpler onboarding process that reduces initial user frustration and potentially increases user retention. The main dependencies would be on the design, development, and customer support teams.

## UX Goals
1. Simplify the onboarding process with clear, step-by-step instructions.
2. Ensure large, easy-to-read text and slower caption speeds.
3. Maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
4. Provide a straightforward troubleshooting process.

## KPIs

4. The troubleshooting process should be straightforward and hassle-free.

## Research Brief
Competitor products have leveraged technology to enhance their onboarding processes, with a focus on personalizing learning for new hires. Users generally appreciate well-organized onboarding processes. However, there is a need to ensure that the onboarding process is accessible to everyone.

Products like Grammarly, Slack, Flipboard, PlanetHS, and Evernote have simplified onboarding processes that can guide the user based on their specific needs, offer a personalized onboarding experience, and provide a step-by-step guide.

## Opportunity Map
Martha needs to learn how to use a new technology that simplifies her life without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the onboarding process. The interface should be clean and uncluttered, with large, easy-to-read text. The user should be able to navigate through the interface smoothly without feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

## Success Metrics
Measure Martha's satisfaction with the onboarding process and the overall user experience through surveys or interviews. Track how often Martha requires assistance while using the technology. Monitor how often and how long Martha uses the technology.

## Prioritization Summary
Simplified Onboarding Process is the recommended concept due to its high feasibility and potential for significant ROI in terms of increased user retention and NPS score. Care must be taken to ensure that in the process of simplification, no essential information or steps are omitted that could confuse users or lead to errors.
