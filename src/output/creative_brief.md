# Creative Brief

## Problem Statement

Our core challenge is to enhance the user experience for older adults using our phone captioning services, particularly those over 65 who are using the mobile app. The main issues are a confusing interface, slow caption speed, and an overwhelming onboarding process. The design should aim to reduce cognitive load, increase perceived responsiveness, and make the onboarding process friendlier. The ultimate goal is to transform the entire experience into an empowering one, rather than one that feels overwhelming.

## Selected Concept

Concept 2: Improved Caption Speed

- **Benefits**: Faster caption speed can increase the perceived responsiveness of the app. This can be achieved by optimizing the speech-to-text algorithms and ensuring the app has sufficient resources to run smoothly.
- **Drawbacks**: Might increase the app's resource usage, potentially causing issues on older devices.
- **Technical Feasibility**: Medium. It involves optimizing the existing speech-to-text algorithms and potentially upgrading the server infrastructure.
- **Dependencies**: Depends on the development team and possibly the infrastructure team. User testing would be required to measure the impact of the changes.
- **Success Metrics**: Reduced time from speech to caption, positive user feedback, increased user engagement.

## Persona Profile

Name: Helen Smith

Bio: Helen is a 70-year-old retired teacher who lives alone in her apartment in Boston. She loves reading, gardening, and spending time with her grandchildren. She uses her smartphone to stay connected with her family and friends, watch videos, and read news. However, she struggles with new technology and prefers simple, intuitive interfaces.

Motivations: Helen wants to stay connected with her loved ones and the world around her. She wants to be independent and not rely on others for her digital needs. She values clear communication and efficient technology that can enhance her daily life.

Frustrations: Helen gets frustrated with complex technology and cluttered interfaces. She finds slow caption speeds annoying, as she often has to wait for the captions to catch up with the audio. She also gets overwhelmed with lengthy and complicated onboarding processes.

Accessibility Needs: Helen needs larger text sizes and high contrast colors for visibility. She also needs a simple and intuitive interface with clear instructions. She requires faster caption speeds for a better user experience.

## Concept Relevance

The Improved Caption Speed concept is highly relevant to Helen. A faster caption speed would significantly enhance her user experience by reducing the lag between the audio and captions. This would make the app more responsive and easier for her to use, thereby reducing her frustration and making her feel more empowered in her digital interactions. However, it's essential to ensure that the improved speed doesn't compromise the accuracy of the captions or the simplicity of the interface.

## Prioritization Summary

1. Concept: Improved Caption Speed
   - Feasibility: Medium. Optimizing speech-to-text algorithms is complex and could potentially increase the app's resource usage and impact server infrastructure. However, it is technically feasible with the right resources and expertise.
   - ROI: High. The market size for captioning and subtitling solutions is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. If we can successfully improve the caption speed and maintain a high level of accuracy, we could potentially capture a larger market share and increase user engagement.
   - Fast Wins: User testing to measure the impact of changes could potentially provide quick feedback and allow for iterative improvements.
   - High-Risk Bets: The potential sacrifice in accuracy with optimized models is a high-risk bet. If the accuracy of the captions decreases significantly, it could negatively impact user experience and engagement.

## Recommendation

The Improved Caption Speed concept should be the top concept to pursue. Despite the technical complexities, the potential for high ROI and increased user engagement makes it a worthwhile investment. However, it is crucial to manage the risk associated with potential decreases in accuracy and increased resource usage.
