Based on the analysis, the concept of Real-time Captioning with User Control is technically feasible and has the potential for a high ROI due to its broad range of applications. However, it also presents a high-risk bet due to the challenges in implementing real-time captioning accurately. If implemented successfully, it can provide a fast win by significantly improving user experience. Therefore, I would rank this concept as the top concept to pursue due to its potential for high ROI and significant impact on user experience. However, careful consideration should be given to managing the risks associated with implementing real-time captioning accurately.
