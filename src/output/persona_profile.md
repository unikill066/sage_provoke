Persona Profile

Name: Martha Stewart

Bio: Martha is a 70-year-old retiree living in a quiet neighborhood in Florida. She enjoys reading, gardening, and staying connected with her children and grandchildren who live out-of-state. She uses her smartphone regularly to make calls, send texts, and use a few select apps. However, she is not very tech-savvy and often finds new technology intimidating and difficult to navigate. Martha has mild hearing loss and relies on phone captioning to understand her calls better.

Motivations: Martha is motivated to stay connected with her loved ones and stay informed about the world around her. She wants to use her phone with ease and without feeling overwhelmed or stressed. She is also motivated to maintain her independence and not rely on others for help with technology.

Frustrations: Martha gets frustrated when technology is complex and not intuitive. She dislikes when apps are not designed with her needs in mind, such as small text size and fast-moving captions. She also gets frustrated when she misses information during calls due to her hearing loss.

Accessibility Needs: Martha needs larger text sizes and clear, accurate captions to compensate for her hearing loss. She also needs a simple, intuitive user interface that does not require in-depth technological knowledge to navigate.

Concept Relevance: The Real-Time Captioning Speed Adjustment feature would be highly relevant for Martha. She would benefit from being able to adjust the speed of the captions to match her reading speed. This would make the app more accommodating for her and reduce the stress she experiences when using technology. However, the implementation of this feature should be done in a way that does not increase the app's complexity or introduce performance issues, as that could deter Martha from using the app.
