Persona Profile:

Name: Helen Smith

Bio: Helen is a 70-year-old retired teacher who lives alone in her apartment in Boston. She loves reading, gardening, and spending time with her grandchildren. She uses her smartphone to stay connected with her family and friends, watch videos, and read news. However, she struggles with new technology and prefers simple, intuitive interfaces.

Motivations: Helen wants to stay connected with her loved ones and the world around her. She wants to be independent and not rely on others for her digital needs. She values clear communication and efficient technology that can enhance her daily life.

Frustrations: Helen gets frustrated with complex technology and cluttered interfaces. She finds slow caption speeds annoying, as she often has to wait for the captions to catch up with the audio. She also gets overwhelmed with lengthy and complicated onboarding processes.

Accessibility Needs: Helen needs larger text sizes and high contrast colors for visibility. She also needs a simple and intuitive interface with clear instructions. She requires faster caption speeds for a better user experience.

Concept Relevance: The Improved Caption Speed concept is highly relevant to Helen. A faster caption speed would significantly enhance her user experience by reducing the lag between the audio and captions. This would make the app more responsive and easier for her to use, thereby reducing her frustration and making her feel more empowered in her digital interactions. However, it's essential to ensure that the improved speed doesn't compromise the accuracy of the captions or the simplicity of the interface.
