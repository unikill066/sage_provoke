# Validation Report

## Heuristics Tested

1. **Visibility of System Status:** The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
2. **Match between System and the Real World:** The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
3. **User Control and Freedom:** Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
4. **Consistency and Standards:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.
5. **Error Prevention:** Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user.
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:** Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
10. **Help and Documentation:** Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

## Flagged Issues and Recommendations

1. **Visibility of System Status:** The system should provide feedback when Harold saves his caption speed settings. This can be achieved by displaying a confirmation message or visual indicator.
2. **User Control and Freedom:** There should be an option for Harold to reset the caption speed to the default setting. This gives him the freedom to experiment with different speeds without worrying about irreversible changes.
3. **Error Prevention:** To prevent Harold from setting the caption speed too high or too low, implement limits on the slider control. This will ensure that the captions remain readable at all speeds.
4. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** The design should include visible labels or icons that clearly indicate the function of each control. This reduces the cognitive load on Harold by allowing him to recognize functions rather than recall them.
5. **Help and Documentation:** A help section or tutorial might be necessary to guide Harold through the process of adjusting the caption speed. This will make the onboarding process more intuitive and user-friendly.

The design of the Adaptive Caption Speed feature meets most of the heuristic standards and addresses the user needs and goals outlined in the Creative Brief. However, there are a few areas, such as User Control and Freedom, Recognition Rather Than Recall, and Help and Documentation, that could benefit from further refinement.
