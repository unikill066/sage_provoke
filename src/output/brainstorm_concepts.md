Concept 1: Simplified User Interface
- Benefits: A simplified interface with larger fonts and buttons can make navigation easier for older adults, reducing cognitive load. Clear, concise labels and instructions can also improve usability. 
- Drawbacks: Simplifying the interface might limit some functionalities or make them less accessible for more tech-savvy users.
- Technical Feasibility: High. It involves redesigning the current interface which is quite feasible with modern design tools.
- Dependencies: Design team, user feedback, and testing.
- Success Metrics: Reduced user complaints about the interface, increased user satisfaction scores, increased usage.

Concept 2: Adaptive Caption Speed
- Benefits: Allowing users to adjust the speed of captions can improve the user experience, especially during stressful calls. Slower speeds can help users who read slowly, while faster speeds can keep up with rapid conversations.
- Drawbacks: Implementing this feature might increase the complexity of the interface and confuse some users.
- Technical Feasibility: Medium. It requires changes in both the front-end (user controls) and back-end (captioning system).
- Dependencies: Development team, user feedback, and testing.
- Success Metrics: Reduced user complaints about caption speed, increased user satisfaction scores, increased usage.

Concept 3: Interactive Onboarding Tutorial
- Benefits: An interactive tutorial can guide new users through the app, making the onboarding process more intuitive. It can also improve user confidence and control by teaching them how to use the app effectively.
- Drawbacks: Some users might find the tutorial unnecessary or annoying, especially if they are familiar with similar apps.
- Technical Feasibility: Medium. It involves creating a new feature which can be time-consuming.
- Dependencies: Design and development teams, user feedback, and testing.
- Success Metrics: Reduced user complaints about the onboarding process, reduced need for customer support, increased user satisfaction scores, increased usage.
