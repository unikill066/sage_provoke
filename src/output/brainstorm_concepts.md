Concept 1: Simplified Interface
- Benefits: A simplified interface can help reduce the cognitive load on older adults. This can be achieved by reducing the number of options on the screen, using larger fonts, and clear, easy-to-understand icons. It can also include a "help" button for quick assistance.
- Drawbacks: Some users might find the simplified interface too basic, lacking advanced options they might need.
- Technical Feasibility: High. It involves UI/UX changes which are typically feasible with existing mobile app development technologies.
- Dependencies: Depends on the UX/UI design team and the mobile app development team. User testing would also be necessary to ensure the new design is effective.
- Success Metrics: Increased user engagement, reduced number of support tickets, positive user feedback.

Concept 2: Improved Caption Speed
- Benefits: Faster caption speed can increase the perceived responsiveness of the app. This can be achieved by optimizing the speech-to-text algorithms and ensuring the app has sufficient resources to run smoothly.
- Drawbacks: Might increase the app's resource usage, potentially causing issues on older devices.
- Technical Feasibility: Medium. It involves optimizing the existing speech-to-text algorithms and potentially upgrading the server infrastructure.
- Dependencies: Depends on the development team and possibly the infrastructure team. User testing would be required to measure the impact of the changes.
- Success Metrics: Reduced time from speech to caption, positive user feedback, increased user engagement.

Concept 3: Guided Onboarding Process
- Benefits: A step-by-step guided onboarding process can make the app more user-friendly. This can be achieved by introducing features one at a time, with clear instructions and the option to repeat the tutorial.
- Drawbacks: Might make the onboarding process longer. Some users might find it unnecessary or annoying.
- Technical Feasibility: High. It involves UI/UX changes and adding tutorial content, which are typically feasible with existing mobile app development technologies.
- Dependencies: Depends on the UX/UI design team and the content team for creating the tutorial content. User testing would also be necessary to ensure the new onboarding process is effective.
- Success Metrics: Reduced number of users dropping off during onboarding, positive user feedback, increased number of users completing the onboarding process.
