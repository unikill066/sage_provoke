Concept 1: Simplified User Interface
- Benefits: Reducing clutter and increasing text size would make the interface more accessible and less confusing for users who are not tech-savvy. It would likely increase user satisfaction and NPS score.
- Drawbacks: Some users may find the reduced functionality limiting. It may also require significant development resources to redesign and implement.
- Technical Feasibility and Dependencies: High feasibility. This would mainly involve UI/UX design changes, which are typically straightforward to implement. The main dependencies would be on the design and development teams.
- Success Metrics: Increase in NPS score, decrease in user complaints related to interface complexity, increase in user engagement.

Concept 2: Improved Caption Speed
- Benefits: Faster captions would reduce user frustration and improve the overall user experience. It would also likely increase user satisfaction and NPS score.
- Drawbacks: This could potentially increase the load on servers and require more processing power, leading to increased costs.
- Technical Feasibility and Dependencies: Medium feasibility. This would involve optimizing the captioning algorithm and possibly upgrading server infrastructure. The main dependencies would be on the development and infrastructure teams.
- Success Metrics: Decrease in user complaints related to caption delay, increase in NPS score, increase in user engagement.

Concept 3: Simplified Onboarding Process
- Benefits: A simpler onboarding process would make it easier for users to start using the service, reducing initial user frustration and potentially increasing user retention.
- Drawbacks: Some important information or steps may need to be removed or simplified, which could lead to user confusion or errors down the line.
- Technical Feasibility and Dependencies: High feasibility. This would mainly involve changes to the onboarding flow and possibly creating additional support materials. The main dependencies would be on the design, development, and customer support teams.
- Success Metrics: Increase in user retention, decrease in user complaints related to onboarding, increase in NPS score.
