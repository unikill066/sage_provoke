1. Concept: Large, Adjustable Text and Simple Layout
    - Benefits: This design feature will make it easier for users over 65 to read the captions. It also reduces cognitive load by presenting information in a simple and straightforward manner.
    - Drawbacks: The simplicity of the layout may limit the amount of information that can be displayed at once. 
    - Feasibility: This is technically feasible as it involves standard UI design principles and does not require any advanced technologies.
    - Dependencies: This depends on the screen size and resolution of the user's device.
    - Success Metrics: Success can be measured by user feedback and the time it takes for users to read and understand the captions.

2. Concept: Voice-guided Onboarding Process
    - Benefits: This makes the onboarding process more interactive and friendly, which can help users feel more comfortable and in control.
    - Drawbacks: Some users may find the voice guidance annoying or distracting. It also requires more resources to implement.
    - Feasibility: This is technically feasible but may require additional resources for voice recognition and synthesis technologies.
    - Dependencies: This depends on the quality of the user's device microphone and speakers.
    - Success Metrics: Success can be measured by user feedback, the number of users who complete the onboarding process, and how quickly they do so.

3. Concept: Real-time Captioning with User Control
    - Benefits: This feature improves perceived responsiveness by providing captions as soon as the user speaks. It also gives users control over when the captions appear.
    - Drawbacks: Real-time captioning can be challenging to implement accurately. It may also increase the cognitive load if the captions are not accurate.
    - Feasibility: This is technically feasible but may require advanced speech recognition technologies.
    - Dependencies: This depends on the quality of the user's device microphone and the speed of their internet connection.
    - Success Metrics: Success can be measured by user feedback, the accuracy of the captions, and the lag time between speech and caption display.
