1. Concept: Simplified UI with Large, Clear Fonts and Buttons
   - Benefits: This would make the app more accessible and easier to navigate for users with visual impairments or motor control issues. It could also make the app less overwhelming and more intuitive to use.
   - Drawbacks: This might limit the amount of information that can be displayed on the screen at once. It could also make the app look less modern or sophisticated.
   - Feasibility + Dependencies: This would be technically feasible with a reasonable amount of effort. It would require collaboration between UI designers and developers, and would need to be tested with users to ensure it meets their needs.
   - Success Metrics: Increased user satisfaction, fewer support calls or complaints, increased usage of the app.

2. Concept: Real-Time Captioning Speed Adjustment
   - Benefits: This would allow users to adjust the speed of the captions to match their reading speed, making the app more accommodating and less stressful to use.
   - Drawbacks: This might increase the technical complexity of the app, and could potentially introduce lag or other performance issues.
   - Feasibility + Dependencies: This would require significant development effort and might require upgrades to the app's infrastructure. It would also require user testing to ensure it works as intended.
   - Success Metrics: Increased user satisfaction, fewer complaints about captioning speed, increased usage of the app.

3. Concept: Interactive Onboarding Tutorial
   - Benefits: This would help users understand how to use the app and its features, making them feel more confident and in control. It could also reduce the number of support calls or complaints.
   - Drawbacks: This would require significant effort to design and implement, and would need to be updated whenever the app is updated.
   - Feasibility + Dependencies: This would be technically feasible, but would require collaboration between UI designers, developers, and user experience researchers. It would also require user testing to ensure it is effective.
   - Success Metrics: Reduced number of support calls or complaints, increased user satisfaction, increased usage of the app.
