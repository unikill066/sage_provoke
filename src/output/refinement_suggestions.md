**UI Tweaks:**

1. **Error Handling:** Introduce a pop-up or banner for error messages. For example, if a video fails to load, an error message could pop up saying "Oops! The video failed to load. Please check your internet connection and try again."

2. **Help and Documentation:** Add a "Help" or "FAQ" button in the main navigation or settings menu. This should lead to a screen with common questions and issues, along with their solutions.

3. **Caption Settings:** The customization options for captions could be expanded. Consider adding options for font size, color, and background opacity to cater to a wider range of user needs and preferences.

**Copy Improvements:**

1. **Onboarding Process:** Ensure the copy during the onboarding process is clear, concise, and friendly. For example, instead of "Choose your caption settings", consider "Let's customize your captions! Choose your preferred font size, color, and background opacity."

2. **Error Messages:** Make sure the error messages are helpful and not too technical. They should guide the user towards a solution. For example, "Video failed to load. Please check your internet connection and try again."

3. **Help and Documentation:** The copy in the help section should be easy to understand, even for users who are not tech-savvy. Use plain language and avoid jargon.

**A/B Test Variants:**

1. **Onboarding Process:** Test different versions of the onboarding process to see which one results in the most users successfully completing it. Variants could include different orders of steps, varying amounts of information, or different ways of presenting the same information.

2. **Error Messages:** Test different wordings and formats of error messages to see which ones users find most helpful and least frustrating.

3. **Help and Documentation:** Test different formats for the help section, such as FAQ vs. a searchable help center, to see which one users prefer and find most useful.
