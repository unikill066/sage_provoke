Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD):

1. As a retired teacher, Helen wants to stay connected with her loved ones and the world around her through her smartphone, so she can maintain her independence and not rely on others for her digital needs.
2. As a user who struggles with new technology, Helen needs an app with a simple, intuitive interface and clear instructions, so she can navigate the app without feeling overwhelmed.
3. As a user with specific accessibility needs, Helen needs larger text sizes, high contrast colors, and faster caption speeds, so she can have a better user experience.

Key Product/UI/UX Moments:

1. Onboarding: The onboarding process should be simple and intuitive, with clear instructions to help Helen understand how to use the app.
2. Use of captions: The caption speed should be fast enough to keep up with the audio, but not so fast that it compromises the accuracy of the captions.
3. Interface: The interface should be clutter-free and use larger text sizes and high contrast colors, making it easier for Helen to read and navigate.

Success Metrics:

1. User Satisfaction: Measure Helen's satisfaction with the app through user interviews and surveys. A successful app would result in high user satisfaction scores.
2. Usability: Measure how easily Helen can navigate the app and use its features. Success would be indicated by a low number of usability issues reported by Helen.
3. Caption Speed and Accuracy: Measure the speed and accuracy of the captions. Success would be indicated by a decrease in the time lag between the audio and captions, without a significant compromise in the accuracy of the captions.
