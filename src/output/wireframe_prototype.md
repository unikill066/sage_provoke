Given Helen's persona, her need for a simplified user experience, and the improved caption speed concept, I will create a user journey that focuses on a simplified onboarding process, a streamlined interface, and enhanced captioning speed. The user journey will include three main steps: Onboarding, Main Screen, and Captioning Screen.

## User Journey

1. **Onboarding**
   - Helen downloads the app and opens it for the first time.
   - She is greeted with a simple and friendly welcome screen.
   - She proceeds through an easy-to-understand tutorial that guides her on how to use the app.
   - The onboarding process ends with a confirmation screen, which assures her that she is ready to use the app.

2. **Main Screen**
   - Helen is taken to the main screen of the app, which has a clean and clutter-free interface.
   - The main screen displays a prominent 'Start Captioning' button, which Helen can easily recognize and press to start the captioning process.

3. **Captioning Screen**
   - Helen presses the 'Start Captioning' button and is taken to the captioning screen.
   - She starts speaking, and the app transcribes her speech into captions.
   - The captions are displayed in a large, high-contrast font, which Helen can easily read.
   - The app delivers the captions with improved speed, reducing the lag between her speech and the captions.

## Wireframe Specs

1. **Onboarding Screen**
   - Screen Title: Welcome to [App Name]
   - Components: 
     - A friendly welcome message (Component Placeholder: WelcomeMessage)
     - A 'Start Tutorial' button (Component Placeholder: StartTutorialButton)
   - Annotations:
     - The welcome message should be brief and friendly to make Helen feel welcomed and comfortable.
     - The 'Start Tutorial' button should be large and prominent to guide Helen to the next step of the onboarding process.

2. **Main Screen**
   - Screen Title: Home
   - Components: 
     - A 'Start Captioning' button (Component Placeholder: StartCaptioningButton)
   - Annotations:
     - The main screen should be clean and clutter-free to reduce cognitive load for Helen.
     - The 'Start Captioning' button should be large and prominent to guide Helen to the captioning process.

3. **Captioning Screen**
   - Screen Title: Captioning
   - Components: 
     - A real-time caption display area (Component Placeholder: CaptionDisplay)
     - An 'End Captioning' button (Component Placeholder: EndCaptioningButton)
   - Annotations:
     - The real-time caption display area should use a large, high-contrast font to make the captions easy for Helen to read.
     - The 'End Captioning' button allows Helen to stop the captioning process at any time.
     - The caption speed should be optimized to reduce the lag between Helen's speech and the captions.

## Figma/Export Placeholders

These specifications are designed to provide a clear and developer-friendly guide for creating the wireframes. They factor in Helen's persona, her motivations, frustrations, and accessibility needs, as well as the improved caption speed concept. The goal is to create a user experience that is simple, intuitive, and empowering for Helen.
