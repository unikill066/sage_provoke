Revised Prompt:
The primary issue is that our phone captioning services' existing user interface is not effectively catering to our user base primarily comprised of individuals over 65, resulting in a lower NPS. Our users, many of whom may not be digitally savvy, find the interface perplexing, the caption speed tardy, and the onboarding process too complex. Complaints vary from delayed captions to a cluttered screen with undersized text. The challenge lies in minimizing the cognitive burden, enhancing the perceived responsiveness, and simplifying the onboarding process, keeping in mind the age and digital comfort level of our target users. The objective is to transform the entire experience into something empowering rather than overwhelming, providing our users with a sense of control and assurance, especially during stressful calls.
