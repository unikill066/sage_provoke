The core problem is to enhance the user experience for older adults using our phone captioning services, particularly those over 65 who are using the mobile app. The main issues are a confusing interface, slow caption speed, and an overwhelming onboarding process. Users are struggling with a cluttered screen, laggy captions and are seeking a simpler, more intuitive interface. The design should aim to reduce cognitive load, increase perceived responsiveness, and make the onboarding process friendlier. The ultimate goal is to transform the entire experience into an empowering one, rather than one that feels overwhelming.
