The core problem to address is the need to improve the user experience for older adults using our phone captioning services, particularly those over 65 years old, by reducing the cognitive load, speeding up perceived responsiveness, and making onboarding more intuitive. This includes addressing issues such as a confusing interface, slow caption speed, and difficult onboarding process. The solution should focus on making the user experience empowering and not overwhelming, taking into account the emotional drivers of our users who desire simplicity, confidence, and control, especially during stressful calls. The design should also consider how to make the captions more visible and less cluttered for better readability.
