Sprint Plan:

Phase 1: User Interface Improvements
Role: UI/UX Designer
Stories: User Story 1, User Story 2, User Story 3
Dependencies: Implementation of multi-step processes, forms, and navigation menu in the app
Risks: Delays in the implementation of the dependencies could push back the schedule
Mitigation: Regular communication and coordination with the development team to monitor progress

Phase 2: Error Handling and Messaging
Role: Copywriter, UI/UX Designer
Stories: User Story 4
Dependencies: Implementation of error handling in the app
Risks: Unclear or misleading error messages could lead to user frustration
Mitigation: Conduct user testing and gather feedback to refine error messages

Phase 3: Help and Documentation
Role: Technical Writer, UI/UX Designer
Stories: User Story 5
Dependencies: Creation of help and documentation content for the app
Risks: Insufficient or confusing help content could hinder user's ability to use the app
Mitigation: Regularly update and improve help content based on user feedback and usage data

Export Format: The sprint plan, along with the identified risks and their mitigation strategies, will be exported to our chosen agile tool, Jira, for tracking and management.

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD):

1. Helen needs to see a progress indicator during multi-step processes (User Story 1).
2. Helen needs form fields to validate her input as she types (User Story 2).
3. Helen needs a 'favorites' or 'recently used' feature (User Story 3).
4. Helen needs clear error messages (User Story 4).
5. Helen needs to be able to access help and documentation easily (User Story 5).

This sprint plan prioritizes the user interface improvements first as they are foundational to the user experience. The error handling and messaging and help and documentation phases follow, as they are dependent on the UI being in place. Throughout each phase, we will be mindful of the dependencies and risks, and mitigate them as needed.
