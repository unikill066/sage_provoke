**Export Format**

The sprint plan will be exported into our chosen agile tool, Jira, in the form of tasks assigned to the respective roles. Each task will include the user story, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and potential risks. 

This sprint plan prioritizes improving the onboarding process first, as it is critical for new users to understand how to use the app. The subsequent phases focus on enhancing the navigation, support accessibility, simplifying the troubleshooting process, and integrating user feedback for continuous improvement. The dependencies and risks are flagged to ensure that they are managed effectively throughout the sprint.
