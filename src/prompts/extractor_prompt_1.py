    into a concise “Problem Statement Prompt,” following the two examples below.

Perfect — here are two sample internal stakeholder meeting transcripts. Each is
followed by the distilled problem statement prompt your agent would generate.
🎧 1. ClearCaptions – Internal Stakeholder Meeting Transcript  
Topic: Improving user experience for older adults using phone captioning services.  
Participants:  
Sam (Product Manager)  
Leah (UX Lead)  
Raj (Engineering Manager)  
Kelly (Customer Support Lead)  
Ana (Marketing Lead)  

Sam: Thanks everyone. I wanted to kick off with some trends we’re seeing. Our NPS is dipping for users over 65, especially on the mobile app. The biggest complaints? Confusing interface and slow caption speed.  
Kelly: Support is hearing the same. We’ve had 42 tickets this month just about laggy captions. One woman said it was like "watching a movie with out-of-sync subtitles." We also get a lot of "Where do I even start?" with onboarding.  
Leah: We watched 5 user sessions last week. Most people tried to tap multiple buttons at once, or missed the captions entirely because the text was too small or the screen was cluttered. One tester literally said, “I just want a green button that says 'Call my doctor' — that’s all I need.”  
Ana: That tracks with our survey data. Simplicity and confidence are top emotional drivers for our users. They don’t want to feel dumb or left behind. They want control, especially during stressful calls like with doctors or insurance.  
Raj: On the backend, we can probably improve caption speed, but UI design plays a big role in perceived speed too. If people are staring at a wall of text, it feels slower even if it’s technically fast.  
Sam: So we’re talking: reduce cognitive load, speed up perceived responsiveness, and make onboarding “friendlier”?  
Leah: Exactly. We need to reframe the whole experience as empowering, not overwhelming.

    <output>
Redesign the ClearCaptions mobile app onboarding and call interface for older adults. Prioritize clarity, low cognitive load, and emotional reassurance. Focus on streamlining the call action flow and improving the perceived speed of caption delivery for critical conversations (e.g., with doctors or service providers).

Testmart – Internal Stakeholder Meeting Transcript  
Topic: Rethinking the product feedback experience for consumer electronics testing.  
Participants:  
Natalie (Head of Product)  
Chris (User Researcher)  
Mo (Technical PM)  
Dina (Sales Director)  
Trent (Design Lead)  

Natalie: We’ve been asked a dozen times in the past month if we can make product feedback feel more “human” — both from our enterprise clients and testers.  
Chris: Right, and during post-test interviews, testers say they feel like they’re shouting into a void. They don’t know if their feedback made an impact or even got read.  
Dina: That’s actually becoming a deal-breaker. Brands want engaged testers, not just survey checkboxes. They’re asking us for better ways to show testers they’re part of the product journey.  
Trent: Our current UI isn’t helping. The feedback form is basically a Typeform slapped on a black box. No follow-up, no framing. There’s no loop closure — nothing to make it feel collaborative.  
Mo: Could we integrate some form of live sentiment tracking or even visual feedback summaries? Like “Here’s what you said” or “You’re one of 12 users who reported this”?  
Chris: Even a micro-touchpoint like “Thanks — we shared this with the product team” could boost trust. We also need to show how the data rolls up into product insights. Right now it just disappears.  
Natalie: So the challenge is: design a feedback system that’s transparent, participatory, and adds value for both sides. Testers want voice and visibility. Clients want insight and engagement.

Redesign the product feedback interface for Testmart to create a more participatory, transparent, and human experience. Enable testers to feel heard and see the impact of their input. Provide brands with synthesized insights that are traceable to tester sentiment and behavior, while maintaining trust and engagement.

    Now, given a new &lt;transcript&gt;…&lt;/transcript&gt; block as your input,
    produce **only** the distilled &lt;output&gt;Problem Statement Prompt&lt;/output&gt; as
    **one continuous paragraph**—**no** bullet points, lists, line breaks, or extra tags.
